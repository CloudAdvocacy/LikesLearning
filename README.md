# LikesLearning

### What Affects No. of Likes on Instagram?
### Data-based Investigation using Cognitive Services and Visual Studio Codespaces

In this example, we will try to figure out what makes people like pictures on Instagram more. To do so, we will use [Cognitive Services Vision API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/?WT.mc_id=ca-6956-dmitryso). Computer Vision contains pretty powerful pre-trained neural network models that can extract a lot of interesting info - you can test it [on this page](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/?WT.mc_id=ca-6956-dmitryso) by uploading your own photos.
